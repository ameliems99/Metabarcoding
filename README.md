BIOL 432 Assignment 8

This analysis looks at how communities of plants differ across sample locations. The results were obtained from a floristic survey taken at the Queen's University Biological Station. The goal is to identify: 
1. What effect (if any) does garlic mustard have on the plant community?
2. What has a stronger effect on plant communities: the presence/absence of garlic mustard (in/out) or sampling population?
